**Duration:** August 2022 - January 2023
- Overseeing the development and maintenance of **Phase 2 of HWAC**, a backend REST API designed for Vodafone to facilitate the approval of licenses for constructing cell towers.
- My primary responsibility involved converting a single Excel data sheet containing all the complex cell tower components data into multiple Excel sheets used by Phase 1 APIs. Remarkably, I completed Phase 2 well ahead of schedule, finishing approximately **two weeks earlier than anticipated**.
- Developing and maintaining **MedicineBorsa**, a web application tasked with comparing medicine prices across various inventories and presenting them to users or other inventories for potential purchase.
- Successfully addressed a long-standing issue that had plagued the project for over three months, involving the accurate matching of medicine names from inventories to the correct medicine names. I resolved this challenge through string matching techniques and parallelization with Apache Spark, transforming a task that previously took weeks of manual matching into approximately **30 seconds up to 2 minutes of automated matching** depending on the amount of data, with only about 1 hours required for reviewing the results.
